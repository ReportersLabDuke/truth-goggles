			<h1>Feelings, Food and Genetic Engineering</h1>
			<p>As the old saying goes: A person's got to eat! But reliably feeding the global population is easier said than done. This is why, in order to supply enough food around the world, farmers and scientists have begun to incorporate a few controversial techniques in the way they grow and produce the stuff that goes into our meals.</p>
			<p>For the past 10,000 years, humans have been using technology to improve the way we feed our species, but some of the techniques developed in the past century are raising concerns among some politicians and environmentalists alike. In the last few decades we have seen an introduction of Genetically Modified Organisms (GMOs) into the marketplace.</p>
			<p>To create a GMO, scientists artificially incorporate genetic material from other plants and animals into harvests in order to create crops that exhibit specific new traits. For example, modified cotton seeds have been designed to help the resulting plants withstand insect attacks, which allows farmers to avoid use of synthetic chemicals and other pesticides.</p>
			<p>One of the motivations behind this kind of development is the fact that the United Nations predicts that the global population will hit 9 billion people by 2050. Feeding that many people is going to take a lot of food, and forecasters are concerned that we will not be able to meet the demand if the current trends do not change.</p>
			<p>The promise that genetically modified crops could help feed the world is at least as old as the commercialization of the first transgenic seeds in the mid-1990s. The corporations that helped turn genetically engineered crops into a multibillion-dollar business, including the large chemical companies Monsanto, Bayer, and DuPont, promoted the technology as part of a life science revolution that would greatly increase food production. So far the promise of increased food production has turned out, for a number of reasons, to have been somewhat empty.</p>
			<p>So far, the short list of transgenic crops used directly for food includes virus-resistant papaya grown in Hawaii, Bt sweet corn recently commercialized in the United States by Monsanto, and a few varieties of squash that resist plant viruses. That list could be about to grow, however, as the Indonesian agricultural agency expects to approve a blight-resistant potato soon. There are also a wide variety of inedible applications for GMOs outside of food production, ranging from energy generators to providers of transplant organs.</p>
			<p>But regardless of the use case, tampering with something as complex as genetic information has the potential for unexpected side effects. After all, these alterations are generally designed to change the organism's metabolism, growth rate, or response to external environmental factors. These consequences have the potential to influence not only the GMO itself, but also the natural environment in which that organism is allowed to proliferate.</p>
			<p>These kinds of risks are part of the reason that the FDA regulates GM foods as part of the coordinated framework of federal agencies that also includes the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA). However, critics of this system complain that the regulation is opt-in, meaning there is no centralized government body responsible for evaluating the products.</p>
			<p>Clearly we need to find a safe, healthy, sustainable way to feed the world for generations to come. For now all eyes are on researchers to decide whether or not GMOs can meet all of those conditions; if not, we will just have to cross our fingers hoping for the next agricultural revolution.</p>

				<li>
					<div class="statement">TRUE: Modified cotton seeds have been designed to help the resulting plants withstand insect attacks, which allows farmers to avoid use of synthetic chemicals and other pesticides.</div>
					<div class="explanation">
						<p>Pest resistance can be extremely costly, requiring farmers to spend a lot of time and money on pesticides.  Additionally, these pesticides bring about numerous hazards for farm workers themselves and can encroach on consumers' health.  GMOs are helpful in curbing these problems because they help eliminate the need for pesticides in the harvesting process.</p>
					</div>
				</li>
				<li>
					<div class="statement">TRUE: These consequences have the potential to influence not only the GMO itself, but also the natural environment in which that organism is allowed to proliferate.</div>
					<div class="explanation">
						<p>A study showed that pollen from Bt corn, corn bioengineered to resist the European corn borer, a crop pest which can cause significant damage to crops, caused high mortality rates in monarch butterfly caterpillars. Although the killing of insects is the goal in pest resistance, it can flow into other unintended species.</p>
					</div>
				</li>
				<li>
					<div class="statement">TRUE: This regulation is opt-in, meaning there is no centralized government body responsible for evaluating the products.</div>
					<div class="explanation">
						<p>The FDA policy places responsibility on the producer or manufacturer to assure the safety of the food, explicitly relying on the producer/manufacturer to do so: "Ultimately, it is the responsibility of the producer of a new food to evaluate the safety of the food and assure that the safety requirement of section 402(a)(1) of the act is met." So it is the company, not any independent scientific review, providing the research that is relied on to assert safety. FDA guidance to industry issued in 1997 covered voluntary "consultation procedures," but still relied on the developer of the product to provide safety data.</p>
					</div>
				</li>
				<li>
					<div class="statement">TRUE: We will not be able to meet the demand for food if the current trends do not change.</div>
					<div class="explanation">
						<p>Although agricultural productivity has improved dramatically over the past 50 years, economists fear that these improvements have begun to wane at a time when food demand, driven by the larger number of people and the growing appetites of wealthier populations, is expected to rise between 70 and 100 percent by midcentury. In particular, the rapid increases in rice and wheat yields that helped feed the world for decades are showing signs of slowing down, and production of cereals will need to more than double by 2050 to keep up. If the trend continues, production might be insufficient to meet demand unless we start using significantly more land, fertilizer, and water.</p>
					</div>
				</li>
				<li>
					<div class="statement">TRUE: So far the promise of increased food production has turned out, for a number of reasons, to have been somewhat empty.</div>
					<div class="explanation">
						<p>It's not clear whether that boom in transgenic crops has led to increased food production or lower prices for consumers. Take corn, for example. In the United States, 76 percent of the crop is genetically modified to resist insects, and 85 percent can tolerate being sprayed with a weed killer. Such corn has, arguably, been a boon to farmers, reducing pesticide use and boosting yields. But little of U.S. corn production is used directly for human food; about 4 percent goes into highâ€“fructose corn syrup and 1.8 percent to cereal and other foods. Genetically modified corn and soybeans are so profitable that U.S. farmers have begun substituting them for wheat: around 56 million acres of wheat were planted in 2012, down from 62 million in 2000. As supply fell, the price of a bushel of wheat rose to nearly $8 in 2012, from $2.50 in 2000.</p>

				<li>
					<div class="statement">TRUE: There are also a wide variety of inedible applications for GMOs outside of food production, ranging from energy generators to providers of transplant organs.</div>
					<div class="explanation">
						<p>Many industries stand to benefit from additional GMO research. Work is currently underway to develop plant-derived vaccine candidates in potatoes and lettuce for hepatitis B virus (HBV), enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli (ETEC), and Norwalk virus. Scientists are also looking into the production of other commercially valuable proteins in plants, such as spider silk protein and polymers that are used in surgery or tissue replacement. Genetically modified animals have even been used to grow transplant tissues and human transplant organs, a concept called xenotransplantation.</p>
